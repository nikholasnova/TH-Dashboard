# Image Evidence Checklist

Use this folder for project screenshots/photos.

## Required Files

- `node-circuit.jpg` - Sensor node wiring and hardware close-up (one per node)
- `measurement-setting.jpg` - Physical placement of one or more nodes
- `dashboard.png` - Web dashboard showing active devices
- `supabase-readings-proof.png` - Supabase table showing rows from your device IDs

## Caption Template

For each image, include 1-2 lines in the main `README.md`:

- what is shown,
- why it verifies system behavior (wiring correctness, deployment setting, multi-node data, etc.).
